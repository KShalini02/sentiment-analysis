# Sentiment Analysis on TweetsðŸ˜Š

This Python script performs sentiment analysis on tweets using the TextBlob library. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing,
sentiment analysis, and visualization of sentiments.

Sentiment Analysis is the process of â€˜computationallyâ€™ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral.
Itâ€™s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. 

## Sections:

### 1. Import Libraries and Load Data
- The required libraries are imported, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, TextBlob, nltk, and wordcloud.
- The tweets are loaded from a CSV file ('tweets.csv') into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Basic information about the DataFrame is printed, including its shape, head, and null values.
- Data cleaning is performed to handle special characters, URLs, mentions, and hashtags.

### 3. Text Preprocessing
- A function `data_processing` is defined to preprocess text data by converting to lowercase, removing URLs, mentions,
and non-alphanumeric characters, tokenizing, and removing stopwords.
- Duplicates are removed from the 'texts' column.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis
- The TextBlob library is used to calculate the sentiment polarity for each tweet.
- Sentiments are categorized as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'.

### 5. Data Visualization
- Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to create count plots and pie charts to visualize the distribution of sentiments.

### 6. Word Clouds
- Word clouds are generated for positive, negative, and neutral tweets to display the most frequent words.

### 7. Additional Sentiment Analysis Function
- An additional function `analyze_sentiment` is defined to categorize comments into sentiments and random categories.

### 8. Example Analysis
- The `analyze_sentiment` function is applied to the first 10 comments from the 'texts' column of the DataFrame to demonstrate sentiment analysis.
